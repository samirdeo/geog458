# Lab 08 LLM assisted Spatial Analysis and Web Mapping**

**Instructor:** Bo Zhao, 206.685.3846 or zhaobo@uw.edu  
**Points Available:** 50

This lab introduces a practical workflow where **large language models (LLMs)** serve as assistants for both **geospatial data work** and **front-end web publishing**. Instead of building everything from scratch, you will use prompts to guide AI tools (Colab / ChatGPT / Gemini) to:

- collect or generate location-based data,  
- visualize it on a map,  
- generate a simple web front-end (**HTML + CSS + JavaScript**), and  
- publish the project on **GitHub**.

> **Guiding question:** In what ways can prompting with natural language help us create clearer, more accurate maps?

## Note on This Tutorial + Web Map Generation

The Colab tutorial mainly demonstrates how to use an LLM to **help with downloading, cleaning, and transforming spatial data** (e.g., geocoding + basic mapping/preview).  

To generate a real **web map**, you will need to:

1. **Export and download your processed data** from Colab (GeoJSON or CSV), then  
2. Use an AI tool for **“vibe coding”** to generate the web project files (**HTML/CSS/JS**) and build the interactive map, and  
3. Upload everything to GitHub and publish it (GitHub Pages recommended).

If you are not familiar with “vibe coding,” you can quickly look up simple examples/tutorials online and follow the basic workflow:  
**prompt → generate code → test in browser → refine → publish**.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Use LLM prompting to guide a basic spatial workflow (e.g., geocoding + mapping)  
- Export your data into a web-friendly format (**GeoJSON** or **CSV**)  
- Use an LLM to generate a simple interactive web map (e.g., **Mapbox GL JS** or similar)  
- Publish the project to **GitHub** as a small Digital Geographies web project

## Submission

All deliverables must be submitted via **Canvas** by the due date.

Submit **one URL**:

- The URL to your published Digital Geographies project on GitHub.
