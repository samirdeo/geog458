# GEOG 458 AI Policy
 
**The Instructional Team｜Effective Date: Jan 28, 2026**

GEOG 458 is designed to strengthen your critical thinking and your ability to build digital geography projects with real technical foundations. To meet these goals, your thinking must remain your own: AI must not replace your reasoning, interpretation, or writing. 

At the same time, you will likely use AI in future technical workplaces. However, effective AI-assisted work depends on having solid fundamentals first. That is why this course emphasizes hands-on learning—especially in lab sessions—so that AI can support your learning (e.g., debugging) rather than bypass the skill-building process.

> This policy applies to all assignments submitted on or after Jan 28, 2026. Work submitted before this date will not be evaluated under this policy.

Below, we summarize the rules for Think Pieces, Labs, and the Final Project, and we provide an AI Disclosure template. Starting from the effective date, every deliverable must include an AI Disclosure at the beginning.


## 1. Think Pieces

**Not allowed:** Using AI to write, rewrite, expand, or polish your Think Piece (including generating paragraphs, arguments, structure, or conclusions).

**Allowed:** Using AI for limited support tasks such as identifying keywords, locating potential sources, or generating questions to investigate further.

All writing and interpretations must be your own, and sources must be independently read and verified.


## 2. Labs

**Not allowed:**  Unless a lab explicitly states that AI use is allowed, AI may not be used to complete the lab for you (including generating code solutions or completing steps on your behalf).

**Allowed:** In labs without explicit permission, AI may be used only for debugging, such as explaining error messages, helping locate bugs, or suggesting minimal fixes. You must be able to explain what went wrong and why the fix works.

**Exception:** Lab 8 is explicitly AI-focused and therefore allows broader AI use, as specified in the Lab 8 instructions.


## 3. Final Project

**Not allowed:** Using AI to write the project’s narrative components, including analysis, interpretation, reflection, or other substantive written sections.

**Allowed:** Using AI to debug, explore interface/interaction design, brainstorm features, and receive code refactoring suggestions—provided that you understand, integrate, and can explain your system.

## 4. Required AI Disclosure

At the beginning of every **Think Piece**, **Lab**, and **Final Project** submission, include a short AI disclosure (2–4 sentences):

> **AI Disclosure:**  
> I used AI in this assignment for: ____ (e.g., debugging only / locating source leads / interface design exploration). I did not use AI to write or complete any components where AI use is prohibited. If AI was used for debugging or development, I am able to explain the relevant code and decisions.

If no AI was used:

> **“No AI tools were used in this assignment.”**


## 5. Suspected Violations

Suspected violations of this AI Policy will be referred to the [UW Community Standards & Student Conduct](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/for-students/academic-misconduct/) for formal review and investigation. We may withhold grading on the relevant component while the matter is under review. After the University process concludes, the instructional team will grade the work in light of the findings, consistent with UW policy.
