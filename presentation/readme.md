# In-Class Presentation Guideline

## Timing
Each class session is about 80 minutes. For the presenting team, please plan for ~30 minutes total:

- ~20 minutes for the presentation
- ~10 minutes for Q&A

Please aim to finish the main content around 20 minutes so we have enough time for discussion.

## Slides
If you plan to use slides, please send them to me before your presentation (a Google Slides link is preferred). This helps us avoid spending class time on setup and troubleshooting. During your presentation, you are welcome to present in any format you prefer (slides, demo, website, map, etc.).

## Content (Paper or Project)

Paper presentation: Clearly explain the paper’s main argument, key points, and why it matters. You should also briefly connect it to this week’s topic/readings. Critical reflections are welcome.

Project presentation: Explain the project’s goal, show its main features (a demo is great), and briefly describe how it is implemented (data, tools, basic workflow). Please also connect it to this week’s topic/readings, and feel free to share ideas for improvement.

## Teams & Schedule

Teams have already been assigned. On the course weekly schedule, each presentation item includes the assigned team label (e.g., AA01, AB01, AC01, AD01). Please check the schedule and prepare accordingly.
